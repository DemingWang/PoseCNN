install mentioned dependencies and oiio branch R1.8(later won't work atleast master didn't) and cmake 3.6 is needed 3.5 won't work because 3.5 FindBoost.cmake is
too old to find boost 1.58 correctly, even thought they got bundled together...
add with cmake-gui
cmake -DWITH_PYTHON_INSTALL=OFF -DWITH_PLAYER=OFF -DWITH_PYTHON_MODULE=ON ..
