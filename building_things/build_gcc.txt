In general /usr/bin should have the default gcc and cc pointing at gcc and /usr/local/bin should then have the newly
installed gcc. Careful it overwrites old gcc in /usr/local/bin, so maybe rename old one with version number and then create
a symlink to gcc and cc pointing to gcc under /usr/local/bin
